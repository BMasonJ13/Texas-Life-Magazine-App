Things I learned:
1) I could have made so many more components... Like if I just would have made the actual cards, headers, and subtitles components
I could easily implement more color schemes. I may go back and do that if I have time and if the client wants it.

2) Shared-Styles folder was a good idea but likely if you need a 'Shared-Styles' folder they can most likely be put into a component for easier use.

Update on 1 and 2 I made "subcomponents" which the main components use for their application. Took like 45 minutes to an hour.
